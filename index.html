        <p>The fifth largest moon in the solar system, Earth's moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot.</p>
        
        <p>Earth's Moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot.</p>
        <p>The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth.</p>

        <ol>5-Need-to-know things about the moon:
           <li><h3>SMALL COMPANION:</h3>
            If you set a single green pea next to a U.S. nickel, you'd have a pretty good idea of the size of the Moon compared to Earth.</li>
           <li><h3>CONSTANT COMPANION:</h3>
            The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It goes around the Earth at a distance of about 239,000 miles (385,000 kilometers).</li>
           <li><h3>CAN STAND ON IT:</h3>
            The Moon has a solid, rocky surface cratered and pitted from impacts by asteroids, meteorites, and comets. </li>
           <li><h3>BRING A SPACESUIT:</h3>
            The Moon has a very thin and tenuous atmosphere called an exosphere. It is not breathable.</li>
           <li><h3>MOONLESS:</h3>
            The Moon has no moons.</li>

            FAQ: What is a Lunar Eclipse?
            <li>A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon and Sun are on opposite sides of Earth.</li>
            <li>A partial lunar eclipse happens when only part of Earth's shadow covers the Moon.</li>
            <li> On Earth, people can experience solar eclipses when Earth, the Moon, and the Sun line up.</li>
            <li>Learn more in our <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/eclipses/home/" >special eclipses section.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>During some stages of a lunar eclipse, the Moon can appear reddish. This is because the only remaining sunlight reaching the Moon at that point is from around the edges of the Earth, as seen from the Moon's surface. From there, an observer during an eclipse would see all of Earth's sunrises and sunsets at once.</p>
